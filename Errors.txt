Shared type 'INSERTTYPE' doesn't match the original declaration in other module
    
    Meaning? You have two seperate modules that declare a shared type with the same name, but they do not match exactly.
             This can occur even if both modules use the same source file.
    
    Cause?   Modifying a shared type and rebuilding.
             Making a copy of the shared type and modifying it without removing the original.
    
    Fix?     Make sure the #include path is exactly the same in both files.
             Rename the type.
             Replace the original type.
             Make the type no longer shared.
